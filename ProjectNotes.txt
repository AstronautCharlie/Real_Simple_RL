TODO: 
- make get_abstr_from_ground deal go from finest mesh to current mesh, not observation to current mesh 

- Make sure q-value updates are actually applied to all cells mapped to the same abstract state 
-- add group_dict functionality 

Discretization: 
- get_most_visited_abstr_state doesn't include exclude_singleton - this may be necessary, but shouldn't be with fine enough mesh 
- Grid mapping makes assumption about state space - see TODO in DiscretizationAbstraction
